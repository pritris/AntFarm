	<h1>💧 The Rain</h1>

<div class="content">
	<p>I used to be a Pluviophile.(2010-2017)</p><p><b>Pluviophile?</b></p><p>It’s a combination of two Latin words : Pluvia and Phile</p><p>Pluvia means “Rain” & Phile means “a lover of something”</p><p>So, Basically A lover of Rain – someone who finds joy and peace of mind during rainy days.</p><p>I am not a big fan of Nature<i style="color: rgb(34,139,34);">(meaning, I haven't been around too much to experience it so in a way, I'm still on this expedition where I'm still exploring Nature and its beauty)</i> and when I tell this to people, they don’t get it. They’re always spewing multiple questions at me. Most of these people find me quirky and tell me rather advise me that I should observe more. They ask me to watch a sun rise and sun set, go out and stare at the sky - into void. They ask me to listen to birds chirp, this and that.</p><p>They often send me pictures of Mountains and Sea to encourage me towards Nature.</p><p>For me, I have never given much thought about it, about Nature, I haven’t really asked myself why I'm not so obssessed with it.</p><p>I have asked other questions though, some of them are  - <br>How long can you watch a sunrise or sunset? I mean it’s a regular and a natural phenomenon. It happens everyday.<br>How long can you stare at the sky and compliment different colors.<br>How long till you’re finally bored with staring at the peak of mountain.<br>How long can you watch a River flow through.<br></p><p><b>However,</b> when it came to rain, I always felt differently. It was always a delight being in it, being in the moment.</p><p>I still remember those times when I used to get drenched on the way from school. My mother used to yell at me. She’d say things about being sick and the uniform getting dirty. I have memories where it rained mostly when I was at home from school. I used to rush straight to the rooftop and dance in the rain.</p><p>If I remember correctly, for that 14 years old kid, rain had different and several meanings.</p><p>It was not just about getting drenched in the rain and having fun – Rain was kinda like a sign to her, a sign of new things to come and change the existing elements in life. It was a hope to keep going and realize that one day; things will be better, finer and amazing. </p><p>Sometimes, it reminded her to let her fears flow, with the rain.</p><p>And she used to drench all the way believing that with this season’s shower, the negative thoughts will be washed away and when it will stop showering, She will be nothing but a positive and a pure person.</p><p>There used to be and still is a tree at a fine distance from my house. It’s a big tree and is visible from here. I remember when it used to rain heavily the tree used to stand still yet the inclination was towards the direction to the wind.</p><p>And I used to think, it will now definitely fall down at one of the houses below. </p><p><b>DUH!</b></p><p>Little did I know that the dyeing branches were getting a glimpse of life again. I remember asking myself 	<b>if, if </b> Rain could also cleanse me like it did for that and million other trees. </p><p>If It could also bring me to life just the way it revived that tree.</p><p>If I could be found too or at-least I can find for what’s been lost and what’s been missing.</p><p><b> // But </b> now, for about three years, I haven’t really gotten drenched – it’s all so irritating looking at the mess it makes when it stops.<b> The MUD, The WATER, The MESS – EVERYWHERE. 😖</b></p><p>It makes me annoying.</p><p>Plus, it makes me lay in my bed whole day. It makes me lazy and more annoying.</p><p>Regardless of how I feel today, It was better before – When my standpoint towards rain was different.</p><p>I wish I could be like her(Young Me) again.</p><p><b><i>Maybe when it will rain next?</i> 🙂</b> </p><p>Because</p><p style="color: #00008B"><b><i>It’s a journey, a journey to find oneself and rain has always been a reminder, a reminder that yells one must go to return, one must be lost to be found.</i> </b></p>
