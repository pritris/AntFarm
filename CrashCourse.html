		Patriarchy

	<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So, basically Patriarchy is something where males have the superior authority over everything, be it at home, society, politics. India is also a patriarchy society where Male members of family hold absolute charge and women roles are assumed to be more towards womanhood wifehood & motherhood. In Indian culture if it’s a son of a house, he will be viewed as the heir to the property whilst the daughter child will be viewed as “paraya dhan” someone who’ll be living in a different family after marriage.<br>
    We need to understand here that in a patriarchy society where Males are given primary power over women shows that Men are in charge that they are the decision maker of the family that they’re stronger, independent, bread-winner and who has the most control which leads to an understanding of viewing Women as someone who’s weak, dependent and follows what the male has to say or harshly order.

		Sexism
	</div>
	<div class="img">
		<img src="sexism.png">
	</div>
 <p>It’s a remark based on the ideas of what Men/Women should do. It exists everywhere However, women are comparatively more affected by it.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px"><b>How?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 17px">Let’s go back to childhood -</p> 
<p>It arises when Parents encourage their Boy kid to play sports, be active and not cry because they’re boys? And tell their Girl kid to play with dolls, accompany mother in her household work and be more ladylike.</p><p>Years later, she’s married and has a kid – She will then be found working in the kitchen, answering work calls and entertaining her kid while her husband is either working or playing video games as described in the picture.</p><p>What it shows is Women are viewed as someone who’ll despite of having a job will anyway be working in kitchen and that it’s her responsibility to be more active with the kids, whether it’s bathing them, changing them, feeding them etc.</p><div class="image"><img src="SexistSociety.png" width="1100px"></div><p>It exists in workplace where the opportunity is given to someone else because a woman is pregnant and if someone has small kids, it’s asked from a woman to stay at home and look after them.</p><p>These were few of the many ideas of how we’re asked to follow the system -  Now, it leads to our second word, <b>sexist</b> or Sexist comment, sexist comment is based on sexism ideas.</p>
<p>Examples – <br>
<b>(Sexist comments for Females)</b><br>
But Women are too emotional to be managers.<br>
Being on the Market is a Man’s world and will remain so for the foreseeable future.<br>
Female brains just aren’t as logical.<br>
All of you girls line up to give him as a wedding present.<br>
What kind of a sick item song is that, it doesn’t have any hot girl dancing in it.<br>
</p>
<p>
	<b>(Sexist comments for Males)</b><br>
You’re so sensitive for a guy.<br>
Pink is a girls’s color.<br>
You got hit by a girl?<br>
Really? But boys don’t play with dolls, We play with G.I Joe.<br>
You’re running like a girl, Man up.<br>

		Misogyny

	<div class="img">
		<img src="Misogyny1.png" height="50px">
	</div>
	<p>Misogyny is a visceral hatred of women. Misogynists will do anything to demean women, belittle them to any extent and they’ll do anything to make women feel miserable.</p><p>Misogynists are sometimes perceived as living upto double standard. It doesn’t mean that a misogynist won’t have a relationship or they won’t get married to woman. It means, they will claim to love their partner however, at every step they’ll give messages which will show that women’s feelings and values have little to no meaning in his life and thus in the household.</p>
	<div class="content-heading">
		Feminism
	</div>
	<p style="font-style: italic;">Finally, Long Awaited One.</p>
	<div class="img">
		<img src="femi.png" width="1000px"; height="50px">
	</div>
	<p>As you may tell from the definition that Feminism is to gain equality of the sexes(includes Males as well as Females).</p><p>There were videos released by someone on Social media who said that they’re against Today’s Feminism. The whole video claimed to have based on Feminism however, it had little to no connection to the term or to the concept – </p><p>Infact the whole video was about Misandry and Pseudo-feminism(You’ll see)</p>
	<p style="font-style: italic;">Let’s discuss the pointers – </p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>•	The word Feminism – </b>They said, “Feminism word has Fem in it which basically means females therefore we aren’t talking about equality here”.  </li><p>Feminism as a movement when started way back in 18th Century, it was solely based on the idea of <u>uplifting Women Rights.</u> Because Way back, Males already had all the power and women were the one suffering. In Western History, women were domestically abused, they were denied to have right  of franchise, they were denied to own the property, to study, to work, to socialize or to participate in public life of any sort. They were even sold by their husbands. Back then, men could do anything to a Women and they were not allowed to pin-point. </p><p>When Women realized that they cannot stand domestic violence and started educating themselves about their rights, they started working on them, they voiced their opinions, they raised their concerns, they stood up like fighters and started this march where they were asking for equal rights. </p><p><b>Note :</b> This movement was never to demean men in any way, it was never to have supremacy over males or to be above them.</p><p>This Movement was simply to have Women rights equal to Men.</p><p>So to answer, Feminism has “Fem” in it because it was initially started for Females only.</p><p><b>You want more clarity?</b></p><p>Let’s take an example of Black lives matter – I’m sure by now everyone is aware of the protests happening in USA, I have seen videos and posters highlighting “All Lives Matter” – Of-course, all lives matter and that goes without saying but look at the current situation, White people any way have all the right, the minorities and underprivileged are the ones who’re suffering and that’s why they’re fighting for Black Lives.</p><p>You cannot start a campaign by broadcasting “All Lives matter” because it wouldn’t highlight the real issue or to say what’s happening currently, it wouldn’t highlight what’s been happening to black people for decades and it wouldn’t highlight their suffering.</p><p><b>Likewise, </b></p><p>If Feminism movement wasn’t started with Females rights, We wouldn’t had highlighted women suffering and then we’d be generalizing all the rights(males and females) knowing that males already have those.</p><p>So, saying Feminism has Fem in it so it favors Females is just a baseless argument.</p>
		<li><b>•	Definition – </b>They said, “Today’s feminism is just about demeaning men and supremacy of Women over men”</li></ul><p>Let’s discuss two other terms for “Demeaning Men and Supremacy of Women over Men”</p>
		<div class="content-heading">
		Misandry
	</div>
	<div class="img">
		<img src="Misandry.png" height="100px">
	</div>
	<p>The term misandry means hatred of men. Women who hates Men. Women who bash out on Men. Women who oppress Men. Women who accuse Men.</p>
     <div class="content-heading">
		Pseudo-Feminism
	</div>
	<div class="img">
		<img src="PS.png" height="50px">
	</div>
	<p>Pseudo-Feminism isn’t Feminism rather it is something which believes in oppression of opposing sex(Males) and asks for rights  above Men. This term is directly related with Misandry and so Pseudo-feminists are those who feel they’re superior to all other sex and that Women should have more power over men in society.</p>
	<p>Therefore Guys, if you know any of the women who accuse opposite sex that means they’re not feminists, they are misandrists and pseudo-feminists or at-least they believe in so.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>•	Respect –</b> “Respect Women. Why? Just because you’re a Women”</li><p style="font-size: 20px;">NO! NO!</p><p>Feminists don’t say respect Women just because they’re Women, they say Respect Women despite their Gender, despite the fact that they’re Women. It means don’t disrespect her because she is a woman. In-fact, Respect everyone regardless of their gender.</p><p>I think it’s basic etiquette to respect everyone, respect isn’t based on who’s what. Respect doesn’t have a long list of requirement that people need to fulfill. </p><p>Here Respect  could mean differently – </p><p>1.	Out of humanity – where you respect everyone, you talk politely and behave well.</p><p>2.	Based on their Work – if you’re working in a company and doing a good job, they respect YOU, they respect your WORK.</p><p>But it has limitations too – </p><p>Most of the people don’t respect a person who sweeps, most of the people don’t respect someone who’s a lower caste and works in sewage.So, even if you’re working and helping people by sweeping or cleaning out gutter, people don’t respect you.</p>
			<p>You see – your work sometimes doesn’t define whether you should be respected or not</p>
			<li><b>•	Feminism has now created a social difference which in turn has created Gender division –</b></li><p>They haven’t created social differences. Again, refer to above image – Feminism is equality of Gender and there were already divisions before based on sex that’s why we needed Feminism to uplift and focus on one gender than the other as “other” Gender already had all the rights.</p>
			<li><b>•	Cases –</b> They pointed out, “No-body talks about Manav Singh case – the only comeback you’ll have against this is Nirbhaya Case”</li><p>Let me straight up say that Nirbhaya is not a comeback – Whole world knows about this and it was severe absolutely brutal what happened to her. Any Rape case cannot be a comeback to any statement.</p><p>And Guys not only go through molestation and there are not only men rape cases but depression, toxic masculinity, toxic relationships, pressure/burden,  suicide attempts, heartbreaks.</p><p>The Ratio may be small comparatively yet big enough that they form a huge part.</p><p><i>FYI – Feminists do speak about these cases.</i></p>
</ul>
    <p>I hope we all are clear with the terms now.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 15px; font-style: italic; color: #DC143C"><b>I want to end this piece by saying let’s treat everyone with respect and dignity and fight for equality.</b></p>
