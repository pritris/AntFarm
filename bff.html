Infact I can't remember a time when You weren't in my life.. <b>YIKES! ðŸ¤¢</b> and I have seen us happy, I have seen us crying, I have seen us angry with each other, I have seen us fighting alot but most importantly we have come back together and become  best friends.</p><p><i> It's like Elle and Lee except less drama and no dancing. </i> ðŸ˜¬</p><p>It feels like only yesterday when we were hanging out and I was balling before You about my life- how crappy I have been feeling and all that.. and how You'd just explain things to me, how You'd ask me to be reasonable and say that "It'll pass before You know it."<br> It feels like only yesterday when You and I used to play online games and I used to beat You everytime.<br> It feels like only yesterday when we told each other how sad it is that Sofia left the Podcast.<br> It feels like only yesterday when we used to hunt online for free coupons & discounts.<br> It feels like only yesterday when You and I used to play UNO and Heroes card.<br> It feels like only yesterday when You used to laugh at my jokes. <br>It feels like only yesterday when we used to backtalk to each other(Remember?).<br> It feels like only yesterday when You made a sticker pack of me on telegram just because?<br></p> <p><i>And Now,</i></p> <p>Now You don't reply to my texts, I see You online for hours ðŸ‘€ but You never read them. ðŸ˜” <br>Now You don't even pick up my calls. ðŸ˜­<br> Now You don't laugh at my jokes. ðŸ’”<br> Now You're always busy. ðŸ˜Ÿ<br> Now You have become strange. <br><br><br>WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY <br><br></p><p>It's been more than 2 months and we have barely spoken.<br> Of all the people I have in my life, I'd have never thought I'd find You distant, especially in this CORONA TIME.<br><br> I just keep looking at my <span style="color: Green;">Milton Water bottle </span>which You gifted me just because I didn't have one.<br><br> You know I don't like change asshole so, Stop making amendments because it's driving me CRAZY.</p> </p><p style="color: rgb(47,79,79); font-style: italic;">And also, If You're secretly dating someone or have found someone,<b> I disapprove of them and I'd sincerely request You to please get rid of that person ASAP and come back to me. </b>ðŸ˜Š</p> <p><b>Your Best Friend,</b> <br>Has been and forever will be</p>
