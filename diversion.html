	<p>	The Year was 2013 and I was in 9th grade when I started watching this show called ‚ÄúROADIES‚Äù. No, Not on the TV.</p><p>I had a CORBY II back then and I used to run to the store, get an Internet coupon for &#8377; 10, 20 and recharge it instantly and then watch it on Youtube. I remember sitting on the edge of the sofa and listening to Raghu yelling. <b>scratch that, f*****g up people.</b></p><p>I had several questions back then regarding the show. I used to ask myself why people would want to audition for something where they‚Äôre constantly insulted, where they‚Äôre constantly being yelled at.</p><p>Little did I know the answer is quite simple.</p><p> Four Letters.</p><p style="font-size: 1.3em;"><b>FAME</b></p><p>Most people who become roadies, they‚Äôre known by other people, they‚Äôre keep getting called on other reality shows, they‚Äôre asked to be the lead or to work in INDIAN SOAP or sometimes work in movies and if they‚Äôre lucky, sometimes they‚Äôre asked to be the judge on the show itself.</p><p>So, initially I watched it out of boredom and then I kinda started enjoying judges messing up with the candidates. </p><p>I watched it for few weeks. I watched this one season(the only season) and after that I got bored so I stopped watching it until few days ago.</p><p><i>YES, This Lockdown is crazy.</i></p><p>So, one day I was scrolling through my Instagram feed and I came across this IGTV video where I saw Neha and Raftaar and RannVijay ‚Äì okay, not sure why they picked Raftaar to be on the show and Neha or as a matter of fact Esha..?</p><p>But yeah, that one video and I‚Äôm till date watching it sporadically.</p><p>BUT JUST THE AUDITIONS, not the actual show.</p><p>I feel like auditions are more fun to watch. I must say, the show has evolved in so many ways but there are things that I like about the show and there are things that I dislike. I dislike the fact that sometimes the judges are too easy on some people whereas sometimes, they are a giant pain. I hate to say this(No actually I don‚Äôt care) but sometimes I think the show is rigged. I also don‚Äôt like the way they treat candidates, kinda like a pig. They think they can make the candidates do anything and it wouldn‚Äôt matter. For some reason the candidates who come on the show for auditions, they seem to like it, I mean if it were me I‚Äôd get aggravated, constantly. The other thing which I find quite disturbing is when they agree with a girl sleeping with 7 people and slap a guy for sleeping with 3 girls. Heh!<b> Hepawcrissy! </b>Justifying <b>THIS </b> and supporting for Women rights are two different things and for some reason Neha always tends to mix it.</p><p>Anyway, the  aspect of the show which I like is that they bring out fun side of the people, that they give chances to showcase their talent, whatever that might be. And it is absolutely insane to see that everyone on the show knows how to dance. I mean I am simply amazed to see that people write in their form that they can entertain with dance. What blows my mind even more and is a really good thing about the show is that it provides a platform to youth to come and express themselves and this is one of the shows where people actually open up. They talk about their personal life, their family, relationships, heartbreaks, molestation, assaults, something that they regret, their secrets I mean everything.</p><p>WOW!</p><p style="color: rgb(47,79,79);"><b><i>Irrespective of the good sides the show has brought, I do think it was better before when those two bald guys were judges. I mean Roadies are meant to be stronger and tougher and stronger :P ?? Roadies now is no less than other reality shows. The judges have gone too soft on the candidates.</i></b></p><p>BUMMER.</p>
