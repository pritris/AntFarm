	<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">It was the summer of 2019 when I thought I should try a few more flavours of yoghurt, so I ordered a few of them from Amazon. I liked a few of them, but some I didn‚Äôt.</p><p>For a very long time, Indians were not introduced to packaged items. It was the 1990s when globalisation spread its wings in India. From western clothing to western food everything started to become part of the life of citizens living in the urban areas. Though we felt more connected to the whole world but it came at a price.</p><p>Waste management became a huge problem in India, especially in metropolitan cities. Everyone started to spend more, buy more clothes, gadgets, packaged food, etc. We Indians didn‚Äôt realise the severity of this issue until it raised to an alarming level. Usage of plastic became such an integral part of our lives that now it seems impossible to give up on this. Despite all the efforts (half-hearted) of the government to ban or regulate the usage of plastic, there is no stopping. The only thing that can save us from this massive issue is self-realisation about the severity of the situation, We all have to self analyse what we are doing to our mother earth.</p> <p style="font-size: 15px;"><b>How difficult is it for us to carry a cloth bag while stepping out for a little shopping?</b></p><p style="font-size: 15px;"><b> How hard is it for us to carry our own water bottle instead of buying plastic water bottles at every step during our journey?</b></p><p> So, while enjoying my yoghurt this thought hit me hard and I promised to myself that I will not carelessly generate plastic waste from now on and will try to lower my carbon footprint as much as possible.</p><p> Afterall, Mother earth provides us everything and this is the least we all can do to show our gratitude towards her.</p> <p>After I was done, I poked holes into the empty containers of yoghurt and planted periwinkle in them.</p><p style="font-size: 15px; color: #C71585"><i><b>It is a daily reminder for me to keep my promise that I made to myself.</b></i></p>
