	<h1>🥚 Bird who abandoned her eggs</h1>

<div class="content">
	<p>My family and I love planting saplings and watching them grow. We live in Delhi, so we don't have ample space for our gardening and so we are confined to our rooftops, balconies and a little 	area outside our home. We had a huge bougainvillea plant in front of our home which slowly crept to the second floor. During the spring and rainy season, it worked as eye bleach for us. It
	looked so beautiful and pleasing to our eyes. During the rainy season when the blowing wind used to carry the pink petals with it, it made the whole street look like we were about to
	celebrate some festival. Yes, we also clicked slo-mo videos of wind carrying the petals. It wasn't just an ornamental plant for us. During the hot summer of Delhi, it acted as sunlight filter for my room. Despite having a considerable size window, it didn't let the sunrays make my room super hot.</p>

	<p>The best part of the bougainvillea plant was that from time to time many little birds made it their home by building their tiny little nests. I remember once a Baya Weaver bird took shelter by building its round and beautiful nest. Every time we saw birds flocking around the plant, we felt so happy. But all good things come to an end and so did our beloved bougainvillea plant. Road construction started in our colony, and one day a bulldozer came and mercilessly uprooted it. It was tough for us to stop thinking about it as we were so used to it. Every time I looked outside the window, it felt so awkward and lonely.</p><p>We don't know if we will ever be able to grow such beautiful plant ever again. We still haven't stopped planting saplings though; we now do it on our rooftop. They can't grow as big as the bougainvillea plant because they are grown in a pot but still, they are beautiful and rainy season makes us appreciate them more.</p><p>There was a tailor bird which always used to flock around our home early morning. She used to come and sit beside our window and see herself in the window glass and poke her reflection 🐦. She had a unique sound and that's how we used to know that she's outside our home, on our window sill. Recently she made her nest in one of our plants. I was really amazed after seeing the nest as it was crafted so well even though the plant isn't that big, after all, she's a tailorbird. She laid her eggs inside the nest. They are so tiny and adorable. Even though this is the rainy season, the nest is so well built that not even a single drop of rainwater enters the nest.</p>

	<p> Unfortunately, we haven't seen the tailorbird and it's been days.😔 There might be a possibility that she'd have known that her eggs will not hatch and that's why she abandoned her eggs.😭 We don't know what will happen with those eggs.</p><p style="color: green; font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">I hope crows don't find them and their mother returns.</p>
