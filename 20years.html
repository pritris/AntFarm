<div class="content">
	<p>20 years and I am still a mystery to myself.</p><p>When I meet people my age or even younger ones, they seem to know everything about them. They appear to have that clarity in life, in career, in things they like and things they don’t. I’m not even close to figuring myself out and having known this confounds me. It shouldn’t be that hard right? Well, If I have to be completely honest, I don’t contemplate much on this as I have an excuse to say to myself. I always tell myself that people grow and learn with time and sometimes it takes extra effort for an individual to know them. But these days, I feel crippled and as back as my memory can go, I’ve been feeling more or less the same. I feel weirder. There are thoughts running 24*7 in my mind, even when I’m asleep. Dreams, more like nightmares and anxiety. I am not able to shut these thoughts, even for a while. I’m constantly looking for something. I’m constantly waiting for something. I don’t know what it is but I’m tired of it. It feels like World's boulder is on my shoulder and I’m too tired to carry it, too lost to carry it.</p><p>There were muffled cries but now even those have stopped. It’s just silence that has remained now but this silence echoes louder than a grenade. The only thing that satisfies me is ripping apart an old diary<i>(probably the loneliest things I have done)</i>in which I had written some of the things from the past & some of the things that I’d want in future.</p><p>I wish to seek comfort in someone else but no one seems to understand it, how would they when I don’t understand it myself. So, can’t we compromise? Can’t I be near someone whom I don’t have to tell anything and yet I feel fine?</p><p>I’m scared, I’m tired.</p><p style="color: rgb(105,105,105); font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">I’m restless - because I can’t find my peace. </p><p>I know I sound pathetic but aren't we all pathetic in our own ways? Don't we all feel that things are falling apart? Don't we all feel that we're trapped in our own thoughts and there's no escape? and even though we do feel those things, we find an escape, we learn and get over them. So, in a way I'm still learning and trying to understand even though it doesn't make any sense. <span style="color: rgb(0,128,0) ;font-weight : bold ; font-style: italic;">Maybe one day it will all be clear and will make more sense than it's making right now and then I will come up with another blog. ;)</span></p>
