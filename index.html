         	<p>Hi!<br>We can all agree that so far 2020 has been the most disturbing year of our lives. So much of chaos around the world. A pandemic, worse than any other in the history of humankind. It has made us do things that we didn’t even imagine in the worst of our dreams. Staying at home, keeping distance from our loved ones, not being able to go out to meet friends or movies & most importantly to work from home. It is like the whole world has come to a halt. None of us is used to it. People are trying to adapt to this "new normal" but it is not easy. People get anxious, miss going out, miss the physical touch, miss the fresh air, and because of limited activities that we can do at home, we often get bombarded with boredom. I am not an alien, I also had my fair share of problems with this lockdown but I am not going to bore you with that.
	        After having a conversation with myself, I decided that I am not going to surrender myself to 2020. I have to do something to keep myself away from all the negativity that 2020 has brought upon us. So, I decided to create this website realising that it is going to help me in many ways. Well in summary, it looked a win-win situation for me.
	        I’ll be sharing my two cents with you all here. I have not decided a particular field for the blog, so posts can be about any random topic and as vague as it can be, but I will try my best to keep them interesting and informative.  I might not be correct all the time, so do let me know your feedback.</p>
