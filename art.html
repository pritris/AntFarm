	<h1>ðŸŽ¨ Love is an Art</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
	<p>I donâ€™t want to be disrespectful to all the honest love and pain in this world and I know pain and love are extremes and they should be respected like knowledge is, but I think the problem with most people is that they pretend to be in love or in pain just to romanticize their life. Trends are always about a majority believing in something to be something they hope to be. It seems like a desperate attempt at adding substance to their life. I wish people would lay back and feel what they really are feeling and express that. Honesty is the best way to romanticize life which people donâ€™t realize, even me. I think we - sometimes and mostly take it too casual and when once the fuss is over, we pretend to be blinded by the emotions such as pain and love and heartbreak to further romanticize rather pretend to be someone who was once in love and now has lost it. Moreover, havenâ€™t movies played their role in here as well? People mould definitions. Instead of feeling the emotion, they gather these definitions from different movies and get agonized by various excerpts. They slightly and steadily drift away from the reality. What they fail to understand that life isnâ€™t a well know script to us- it isnâ€™t a movie.</p><p>If only people could look at them as an art and realize<b><i> love is an art and art needs to be understood and not imitated.</i></b></p><p>If only people could realize that itâ€™s not always about a <b>happy ending.</b></p><p>If only people could realize that the Reality is <b> AGGRAVATING</b> ðŸ˜–</p><p>I think in a way, all this is a process of learning. Some people learn fast. Comprehend and Conclude fast. Some just never do in their life.</p><p>Iâ€™m curious to know what you think Love is â€“ what your definition is.</p><p>I on the other hand, donâ€™t have a definition. Not yet. But because I read stories, I know,<span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);font-weight: bold"> love knows no bound. Itâ€™s a combination of impulse and thought.</span></p>
